## Installation

Cloned starter code from ["The Coding Bootcamp"](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet) 
provided in Module 3


## Description

1. The starter code had initial comments of where we needed to work from. From the comments provided, I made steps & combined them with the comments in order begin working on my code contribution. 


    //STEPS:

    //Get references to the #generate element

    //Take user choices and create password

    //Push user choices to own array and/or own string

    //Create password and randomize

    //Remember math.floor and math.random equation

    //returnShufflePassword

    //Write password to the #password input

    //Add event listener to generate button


2. I created all of my variables and grouped together various strings, numbers, and special characters in their corresponding array.
** (Originally, my numeric values were not housed individually in double "(s), as numbers are not considered strings. Due to a bug that arose later in my code, double "(s) were added around each number.) 


3. I added conditional expressions that followed the .prompt/.alert windows for userSelection.


4. I added an operation for randomzing all of the the userChoices and worked with message structure in alerts/prompts/confirm.


5. Over the course of my contribution to the starter code: I continued to add more conditional statements that were applicable to each individual array; I modified the message structure in the alert/prompt windows; I added concat to then merge the arrays in the conditional statements, if chosen by the user; and I added strict equalities (which proved to not be needed in most areas where first implemented).

** When I tried to run my code, I realized I didnt have a prompt for the user to add password length, as well as the windows not being proper confirm windows. This did not allow the me/user to decide which specific preferences for personalization were needed after password length. 
(It was during a class breakout session that a peer reminded me of "window.confirm" (he is referenced below). This helped me switch my prompts to confirm actions).

6. I added the prompt for the user to choose a password length between 8< || >128, and changed windows from being prompt windows to confirm windows.


7. I ran the code

** My console was blank (in devTools),and I was not able to accept all password modifications without getting: "undefined". My code would only generate a password if I disagreed to adding any modifications to the password generator. Another bug I encountered was I couldnâ€™t go back to the original prompt if my input values were not between 8-128 characters.

8. My code was refactored to include individualized functions for each modification, (as I had been using a variable within a variable). Once this was done, the console began displaying every "click".

9. I added a call to shufflePassword, passwordLength. This function is responsible for computing the length&modifications made by the user.

10. Lastly, I closed the function, generatePassword by making a function with the variable for the returned password at the end of shufflePassword & included generatePassword.

11. Step 10 validated the eventListener for writing back the password the user wanted based off of all of their modifications.

Tutoring from Phillip Loy

Class' Discord "Lounge" Study-Group

Assistance was received from our class TA, Shawn on various occasions in post-class breakout rooms, zoom session, and a debugging when my console would not load.

Joshua Dadbin, (class peer) assisted with code de-bugging with window.prompt to window.confirm after 3/10 GitHub merge was not generating as expected.
